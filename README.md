# 06-weather-dashboard

## Description
This project was to challenge me with server side api's, and that it did. I built this project to test my ability/knowledge on fetch requests. I still need to work more on these, and on functions. 

## Usage
Search for a city in the textbox and hit the submit button. Once submitted, you are provided with that city name, current day, current weather, and the next 5 day weather forecast. The city searches are saved and provided below the seach as quick access to choose them again.
